# Alma-Mater-App

The Alma Mater app helps both high-pitched and low-pitched students learn and practice the Georgia Gwinnett College alma mater. This app was created as a project for my mobile applications course, and was implemented using the cross-platform framework Cordova. More information on the project can be found [here](http://wiki.ggc.edu/wiki/AKnobloch:ITEC4550:Spring2017:AssignmentFour), and a demonstration video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itA2j6xpQY0&feature=youtu.be).
